# Student Dashboard Project

The purpose of this project is to allow the user to easily see any student enrolled in the program, their cohort, and their progress towards gradutation. It also allows the user to read and leave comments on the student's performance.

## Setup

To setup this application, first type "npm install" into the terminal to install the required dependencies. Then type "npm run dev" to start the local server and begin running the application.

## How To Use

After setting up the application, interacting with all of its features will be easy. By default you are greeted by a list of all of the students in the program, but if you only want the students from a specific cohort there is a list you can choose from on the left of the page. Simply click on one of the items in the list and the page will display only the students in that cohort then just search for the student you want. On the top right of the student card, you can see whether or not they are on track to graduate. If the are, it will say "On Track to Graduate". If not then it will say "Needs More Time". You can also click on the "Show more..." button to the right of the student's face to show even more information on them. This information includes:

You can also view any 1-on-1 notes that have been made on the student and add your own. Simply write your name and desired note into the form and then click on the "Add Note" button. This will add your note to the list and you can immediately view it below the form.
